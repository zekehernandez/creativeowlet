An sandbox RPG game where you own a mercenary compound. House soldiers of fortune from across the galaxy, 
hire them out on various quests to earn them, and most importantly yourself, big money. Provide your tenants the best in 
training facilities, mess halls, and living quarters. If you have a nicer compound, better mercenaries will want to stay there; better 
mercenaries make more money.
