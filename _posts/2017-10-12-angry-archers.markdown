Think Angry Birds, but with less anger and fewer birds. 
You are an archer who has to defeat all enemies in a fortress with a bow and limited number of arrows.
You can shoot the enemies directly, or use special arrows to spring traps or destroy buildings and defeat enemies as efficiently as possible.

## Gameplay
Each level is very similar to an Angry Birds level. There is the player's location, and a building or set of buildings created by physics enabled building blocks.
In and on the buildings there are enemy characters who patrol the building. There are also cages with trapped allies that the player can gain bonus points for freeing.
The goal of the player is to defeat all enemy characters with the limited number of arrows they have for that level.
Unlike Angry Birds, there will be multiple "vantage points" that the player can shoot from; providing multiple angles of attack.

To shoot an arrow, the player will touch-and-drag, starting from the character's position, to determine the speed and angle of each shot.

### Types of arrows
- Fire Arrows: if a fire arrow sticks to a wooden block, that piece will burn up over time
- Bomb Arrows: bomb arrows detonate with a small explosion shortly after impact
- Grapple Arrows: after impact the arrow is tugged towards the player (along with whatever is attached to it) with a rope; the rope then disappears
