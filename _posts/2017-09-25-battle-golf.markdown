Golf, but with bombs instead of balls. Instead of trying to get a hole-in-one, each player is trying to be the last man standing.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
Each player starts in separate areas of a golf course. The golf swinging mechanics are similar to Mario golf maybe. Along with the usual array of clubs, each player has two kinds of golf balls. The first one is a normal golf ball, the player hits the ball, and then relocates to wherever it lands. The second ball is a bomb that explodes when it hits the ground. If a player is hit with such an explosion, they are eliminated (or lose a health point) and maybe respawn somewhere else.

The players will take turns and try to move within striking distance with their normal golf balls, and then attack with their bomb balls. Obviously, the more accurate you are at a long distance, the better off you will be.

#### Scenarios

#### Potential Issues
- No one wants to move in closer to their enemies, so everyone just takes super far potshots until they get lucky.
