Collect tiny battle bots to battle other tiny battle bots. Each bot has certain directives that control how they behave in combat. Smarter bots win!

## Gameplay
The world is populated with tiny battling robots. Each robot has different actions it can perform, a traveling mechanism, sensors, and targeting systems. The player's goal is to collect these bots and use them to battle other groups of bots. However, for the battling, the player is hardly involved at all. Each battle is a 3v3 team battle. The player will choose 3 of his own bots to enter battle. From there it's up to his bots to win on their own. Each bot will follow it's programming, and hopefully defeat the other team.

Players can aqcuire new bots by a loot box system, from winning a battle, generating them from parts, or fulfilling certain requirements. Bots are ranked not only by their health, attack power, and speed; but also by their directives, or how smart they are. 

### Directives (or programming)
Each bot will have 2 different characteristics: Action and Tactics; along with other stats like health points, attack power etc.
- **Action**: most bots' action will be an attack of some kind; think laser beam, missile launch, or shockwave. But some bots heal teammates, or provide a small forcefield, or provide buffs/debuffs.
- **Tactics**: where is the bot trying to go? Next to the closest ally? Withing firing range of an enemy, but not closer? As close to the strongest enemy as possible? Will it orbit an enemy.

Lower ranked bots will be kind of simple, they will just attack the closest enemy. The higher the rank, the smarter they are. Smarter bots will try to stay out of range of enemy attacks. Smarter bots will also stick close to their teammates. Smarter bots will try to pick off weaker enemies first.
